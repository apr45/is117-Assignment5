# Assignment 5: Spec-Driven Development with AI: From Fog to Shipping 

## Project Overview
I developed a technical aesthetic portfolio designed to showcase my resume to potential employers and NJIT faculty. The project was managed through a structured AI-collaboration process, moving from initial conceptualization to a live deployment on GitHub Pages.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Conceptualization & Strategy
* **Summarization:** I started by using Gemini to summarize the assignment requirements into an easily digestible format.
* **Prompt Engineering:** I reviewed and rephrased assignment prompts to align with my specific goal of creating a "technical aesthetic" brand.
* **Decision Making:** I brainstormed and selected specific tech tools, page structures, design principles, and content models to match my vision.

### 2. Technical Specification & Sprints
* **AI-Generated Spec:** I requested a full technical specification based on my chosen options.
* **Sprint-Based Development:** I broke the project down into **six distinct sprints**.
* **Code Generation:** I worked through each sprint sequentially, using the AI to help generate and refine the necessary code.

### 3. Troubleshooting & Iteration
* **Refinement:** I learned the importance of prompt specificity, often running the same prompts multiple times to compare outputs and find the best results.
* **Technical Support:** When encountering terminal or GitHub errors (such as the merge conflicts and extension errors seen previously), I used AI to diagnose the issues and implement solutions.

## Challenges & Future Improvements
* **Current Obstacle:** I was unable to successfully implement a direct download feature for the resume on the site.
* **Future Goal:** I plan to consult YouTube tutorials to learn the specific file-pathing or HTML attributes (like the `download` attribute) required to enable seamless PDF downloads.
