## Sprint 6: Optimization & Mobile (Polish)

**Goal:** Pass the "Acceptance Criteria" for performance and accessibility.

* **In-Scope:** Media queries for mobile, scroll-spy for the sidebar, Lighthouse audit.
* **Out-of-Scope:** Adding new content.
* **Tasks:**
    1. Move sidebar to the bottom for mobile screens.
    2. Add a small JS snippet to highlight the active sidebar link on scroll.
    3. Check contrast ratios for accessibility.
    4. Run a Chrome Lighthouse report.
* **Files:** `index.html`, `style.css`, `main.js`.
* **Acceptance Criteria:** Lighthouse Performance score $\ge$ 95. Navigation highlights correctly.
* **Avoid:** Adding high-res images that tank the performance score.
* **Evidence:** A PDF or screenshot of a Lighthouse audit showing green scores.
