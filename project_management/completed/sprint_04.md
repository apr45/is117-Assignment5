## Sprint 4: The "Receipt" Engine (Projects)

**Goal:** Build the STAR-method project cards.

* **In-Scope:** CSS Grid for cards, STAR labels, [Source] and [Demo] buttons.
* **Out-of-Scope:** Writing final copy for all projects (use 1 real project + 2 placeholders).
* **Tasks:**
    1. Design a "Receipt" card component (Monospace headers, Slate Grey body).
    2. Ensure each card has two mandatory link buttons.
    3. Structure text specifically into **S/T**, **A**, and **R** sections.
* **Files:** `index.html`, `style.css`.
* **Acceptance Criteria:** Every project card contains at least two clickable "Receipt" links.
* **Avoid:** Making the cards flip or expand. Keep them flat and readable.
* **Evidence:** One fully formatted project card that follows the Content Model.
